== Preface to the First German Edition (Marx, 1867) = =

The work, the first volume of which I now submit to the public, forms
the continuation of my ("A Contribution to the Criticism of Political
Economy") published in 1859. The long pause between the first part and
the continuation is due to an illness of many years' duration that
again and again interrupted my work.

The substance of that earlier work is summarised in the first three
chapters of this volume. This is done not merely for the sake of
connexion and completeness. The presentation of the subject matter is
improved. As far as circumstances in any way permit, many points only
hinted at in the earlier book are here worked out more fully, whilst,
conversely, points worked out fully there are only touched upon in this
volume. The sections on the history of the theories of value and of
money are now, of course, left out altogether. The reader of the
earlier work will find, however, in the notes to the first chapter
additional sources of reference relative to the history of those
theories.
